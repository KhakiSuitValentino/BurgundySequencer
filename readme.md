<h3> User Stories: </h3>
<p> As a user, I want to... </br> -Have a selection of sounds to choose from in my sequencer </br> - Use the sequencer grid to create a rhythm </br> Have a play button to start and stop the sequence </br> Be able to choose the tempo of the rhythm</p>

<h3> MVP Goals: </h3>
<p>-Create a selection of sounds for users to choose from </br> -Use the sequencer grid to program a rhythm </br> -Have the sequence loop to the beginning seamlessly after completion, to create an infinite musical loop </br> -Have a "play" button to start and stop the loop sequence </br> -Have a way to change the BPM (tempo) of the loop sequence </p>

<h3> Stretch Goals: </h3>
<p>-create multiple sound banks for users to enjoy</br>-allow users to upload their own sounds</br>-create audio effect features, such as an echo effect</br>-allow users to save their loops</p>
